<h4>What's next?</h4>
<h6>Back-end Server with REST API</h6>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Being familiar with client-server architecture in VB.Net, the next version should have a true back-end server accessible</li>
    <li>via REST API.  This is necessary for the following reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Have the flexibility to manage business rules and be transparent to the front-end.</li>
            <li>Be able to put more hardware resources on the back-end.</li>
            <li>Move the heavy-lifting in the back-end.</li>
            <li>Keep the front-end light.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>Registration, Login, Restrictions and Activity Tracking</h6>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Add registration and login features to have security:
        <ul>
            <li>Empployee data is sensitive.  Only certain users should be able to access them.</li>
            <li>Prevent unauthorized use of the system.</li>
            <li>Security is a requirement for compliance to industry standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add restrictions on data and features:
        <ul>
            <li>Even among authorized users, some data and features should be restricted depending on the user role.</li>
            <li>Compartmentation is a requirement for compliance to industry standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add user and system activity tracking:
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever happens to the system, the activity logs are critical in analyzing any problem.</li>
            <li>Traceability is a requirement for compliance to industry standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>Improved and Customizable Front End</h6>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Improve the user interface to be more user-friendly.</li>
    <li>Define custom user interface depending on user role:
        <ul>
            <li>Different user roles would want different layout of data.  For example, Finance people would want more employee details.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>First-time Web Developer</h4>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>I had an opportunity to learn web development in C# as a requirement to this job that I was applying for.</li>
    <li>They gave a simple set of requirements which would have been easy to develop in a standard Windows application using VB.Net</li>
    <li>But it had to be as a web application in C#.</li>
    <li>I had no hands-on experience in writing programs in C#, much less developing a web application in it.</li>
    <li>
        So there lies the challenge.  I spent considerable time on this project, which could be broken down as follows:

        <table class="table table-borderless"  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Hours</th>
                    <th>Activity</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>Installation of Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and SQL Express</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>Trying to run the sample web app from the company but failing to do so</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Find a suitable online course in web development in C#.  Found a great online course from Prof. Shad Sluiter.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>15.5</td>
                    <td>Went half-way through the online course until I got confident to start on my one.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>Developed version 1 of this application using ORM.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>Developed version 2 (final) of this application using DAO.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Wrote this lengthy READ ME page.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="trNoSpace">
                    <td>41.5</td>
                    <td>TOTAL</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </li>
    <li>All in all, I spent 41.5 hours in this project including setup, online training, and actual development.</li>
    <li>Though not fast by any standard, I think I made significant progress in my journey to web development.</li>
</ul>
